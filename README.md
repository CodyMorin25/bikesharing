## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this project is to find if investing in the bike rental buisness in a new city would be worth it. One of the main factors to look at is tripduration. It will give us an idea of how many rentals there were, what times are they rented the most and how long they typically are in the month of August. Before we started we needed to make a change in the csv file we are using by changing the colume with the tripduration into datetime. Once that is done just needed to be uploaded into tableau.

## Results

Using tableau 7 different visualtizations were created using the total number of trips, types of users, and trip duration. Below are images and a little info about them:

  - 81% of the users are subscribers, 65% of the users were confirmed males and 25% were confirmed females.
  - Top ride starting and ending locations that are the most touristic and busy are located on Manhattan.

  - Bikes are mostly checked out for 4 to 6 hours
  - Males users take about 3 times more rides than the female users.

  - Most weekdays rides take place around 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.
  - The weekend rides tend to be higher around 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.
  - Also most of these tend to be taken by Males

## Summary

The data shows there is high activity of the bike sharing service in New York during the month of August 2019. The majority of the rides taken where on Manhattan Island, by males mostly during morning and evening rush hour during the weekdays. This seems to suggest that a majority of people use the bike sharing service instead of public transport for their work commute.
Some additional analysis that could be looked into is to compare data from all the months to see trends throughout the year and include weather data to fine if their is a correlation between weather and the amount of rides.
